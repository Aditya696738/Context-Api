A practical demonstration of React's Context API to manage global state seamlessly. This project showcases a simple yet scalable way to use the Context API to share and manage state across your React components—ideal for both beginners and developers aiming to simplify their state management without Redux.

## Overview

In modern React applications, managing state efficiently can become cumbersome, especially as your component tree grows. The Context API provides an elegant solution by allowing you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

This repository demonstrates how to implement a clean, modular Context API setup to control global state. Whether you're managing theme settings, user authentication, or any other form of shared data, this example lays the foundation for scalable and maintainable state management.

## Features

- **Centralized State Management:** Share global state across components without prop drilling.
- **Modular and Readable:** Clear separation between context providers and consumers.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily extendable structure to accommodate additional contexts.
- **Real World Example:** A hands-on demonstration that can be integrated into larger projects.
